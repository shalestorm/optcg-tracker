#  One Piece TCG Stat Tracker

A fullstack matchup tracker and analytics dashboard for the **One Piece Trading Card Game**. Built with a **React frontend**, **FastAPI backend**, and **PostgreSQL database**, this app allows players to log match results, analyze per-leader performance, and monitor win rates over time ‚Äî all in one streamlined interface.

> üõ†Ô∏è Built entirely from scratch ‚Äî including a custom backend and schema ‚Äî due to the lack of any public, up-to-date One Piece TCG API.
